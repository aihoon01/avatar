## Super AI agent for assisting with Job hunt 
An AI agent that analyzes job listings by researching the company, key stakeholders, and current job demands. It then evaluates the user's CV against the job requirements and provides a detailed report with three key components:  

- **Matching**: Highlights areas where the user meets the job requirements, along with an overall match percentage.  
- **Recommendations**: Identifies missing qualifications and suggests relevant resources (e.g., YouTube videos, articles) to bridge the gaps.  
- **Estimations**: Provides realistic timelines and steps for fulfilling the missing requirements.
